# Easy-Family-Tree
Easy-to-use genealogy program

Type in relations like this: [Name 1]'s [relationship] is [Name 2]
For example: John Smith's sister is Jane Smith, Mary Jane's second cousin is Joe Bloggs

The program uses a coordinate system to map out the family.
[Generation coordinate, Sibling Coordinate, Cousin Coordinate, Removal Coordinate]

The first name entered is used as the reference individual with [0,0,0,0] as their coordinates.
Their father would be [1,0,0,0], their sister [0,1,0,0], their aunt would be [1,1,0,0].
More work is needed on this system for it to work with spouses.
